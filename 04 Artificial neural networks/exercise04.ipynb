    "In this exercise, you need to follow the requirements of each question to generate the Python code, and the following example is for referenceï¼š\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample Question: Write a program that takes the user's name as input and prints \"Hello, [name]!\" where [name] is the user's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",

    "- If you enter 'David', the code will output 'Hello, David!', and this will satisfy the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attention\n",
    "- Generally, there will be multiple answers for one question and you don't have to strictly follow the instructions in the tutorial, as long as you can make the output of the code meet the requirements of the question.\n",
    "- If possible, strive to make your code concise and avoid excessive reliance on less commonly used libraries.\n",
    "- You may need to search for information on the Internet to complete the excercise.\n",
    "- Please answer the questions in order."
